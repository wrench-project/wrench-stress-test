## Description 

This is a simple WRENCH simulator that does a lot of busy work so that we
can run a profiler and see where WRENCH could be improved in terms of
speed/scalability.  Starting with WRENCH 2.2, this simulator is now
integrated with the WRENCH source code (which is a much better idea), but
this repo is still here to run the benchmark with older WRENCH versions if
needed.  Furthermore, this repo contains the scripts/Dockerfiles needed to
run all kinds of benchmark experiments with pre-2.2 and post-2.2 
versions of WRENCH.
